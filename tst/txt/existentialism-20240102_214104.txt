existentialism

  Mia Schem was a beautiful girl last summer.  This winter
  she has become a beautiful woman.  The experience of hell
  wears well in the courage to overcome it.  The horrors
  suffered and endured have the greatness of majesty that
  imbues her tattoos with the currency of humanity and
  history.  The magnificence of greatness in the
  independence of individual for all to witness and reflect
  upon.

  In this age when too many succumb to the suggestion that
  the violence of the crime is the public defense of the
  crime, overcoming the crimes against humanity in the
  communication of society and person breaks the familiarity
  of the commons that coddles the cowardice and inanity of
  cynicism and nihilism which constitute the annihilation
  parasitism that are responsible for squandering
  sovereignty to the slavery that relates addiction to
  carelessness and recklessness.
